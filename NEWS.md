# v1.0.0

v1 includes breaking API changes compared to the v0.1 release series. Users should first upgrade to v0.1.1 and run Julia with `--depwarn=yes` or `--depwarn=error` to receive deprecation warnings, which give instructions on how to update your code to the new API. Once all warnings have been fixed, then you should be safe to switch to v1.
